# TSP-ACS

In this repository you can find the articles of the project carried out to solve the Travel Salesman Problem with Ant Colony Systems. The main article and the one that details all the specifics of the project is the [extended version](Paper_extended.pdf), however, a [summary](Paper_summary.pdf) of this article has been created that omits a large amount of detail. 

All the code is in the [notebook](TSP.ipynb) and has the necessary documentation for its correct execution and use.
